Movement tracking is a novel process-tracing method that promises unique access to the temporal dynamics of psychologicalprocesses. The method involves high-resolution tracking of a hand or handheld device (e.g., a computer mouse) while it is usedto make a choice. In contrast to other process-tracing methods, which mostly focus on information acquisition, movementtracking focuses on the processes of information integration and preference formation. In this article, we present a tutorial onmovement tracking of psychological processes with the mousetrap R package. We address all steps of the research process,from design to interpretation, with a particular focus on data processing and analysis and featuring both established and novelapproaches. Using a representative working example, we demonstrate how the various steps of movement-tracking analysiscan be implemented with mousetrap and provide thorough explanations of their theoretical background and interpretation. Finally, we present a list of recommendations to assist researchers in addressing their own research questions using movementtracking of psychological processes.
