Tackling climate change requires both systemic changes and individual lifestyle changes. Are those best placed to understand the risks and solutions to climate change acting on their knowledge? In a large-scale study of $N=9220$ researchers across $115$ countries, we found that climate researchers reported engaging in considerably more advocacy and activism on climate change and, to a lesser extent, high-impact lifestyle changes than non-climate researchers. For details have a look at [the open access publication]((https://www.nature.com/articles/s44168-024-00187-1)) in NPJ Climate Action.
