Hi, I am currently a PhD student at the [Psychosystems](http://psychosystems.org) group at the University of Amsterdam, where I work on time series data in the field of Psychopathology. I am also interested in cognitive psychology, motor control, philosopy of science, statistical modeling and network science. Since 2013, I am an Editor at the [Journal of European Psychology Students](http://jeps.efpsa.org) and I occasionally post on their blog, the [JEPS Bulletin](http://blog.efpsa.org).
