Hi, I am a Postdoc at the [Psychosystems](http://psychosystems.org) group at the University of Amsterdam, where I also recently completed my [PhD dissertation](https://dare.uva.nl/search?identifier=878fd1a0-2932-4114-9950-d783abfbbd10). My research focuses on creating formal theories for psychological phenomena. For example, we recently proposed a [formal theory for Panic Disorder](https://psyarxiv.com/km37w/). Specifically, I am interested in integrating different modeling strategies such as creating generative models that reproduce key phenomena and fitting (parts of) models directly from data. From 2013 - 2016, I was an Editor at the [Journal of European Psychology Students](http://jeps.efpsa.org), and 2016 - 2021 I was the Chair of the [Young Statisticians Netherlands](http://youngstatisticians.nl).
