Hi, I am a Postdoc at Maastricht University with the [New Science of Mental Disorders (NSMD)](https://nsmd.eu/) consortium, where I am part of Team Network and Team Mind-Body Interface, but I also support other teams. In addition, I am a visiting researcher at the Psychological Methods department at the University of Amsterdam, where I am part of the [Psychosystems](http://psychosystems.org) group and the [Theory Methods Lab](http://theorymethodslab.com). My research is focused on developing generative formal theories (or computational models) of psychological systems and creating methodology to support this process. This involves statistical methodology and software, various tools for theory development, work on measurement and research design, and exploratory data analysis to establish phenomena to be explained by theories. I also collaborate with many researchers on applied projects, which allow me to test new methodological tools in practice and are an inspiration for new methodological projects.
