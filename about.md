Hi, I am third year PhD student at the [Psychosystems](http://psychosystems.org) group at the University of Amsterdam, where I work on time series data in the field of Psychopathology. I am also interested in cognitive psychology, motor control, philosopy of science, statistical learning, and meta-science. From 2013 - 2016, I was an Editor at the [Journal of European Psychology Students](http://jeps.efpsa.org), and currently I am on the board of the [Young Statisticians Netherlands](http://youngstatisticians.nl).
