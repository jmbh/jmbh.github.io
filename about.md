Hi, I am fourth year PhD student at the [Psychosystems](http://psychosystems.org) group at the University of Amsterdam. I am interested in modeling psychological phenomena (usually psychopathological symptomatology) from two perspectives: first, with statistical network / time series models that can be identified by empirical data. And second, with plausible mechanistic theories formalized as dynamical systems. Recently, I am especially interested in the relation between the two, and generally in how to empirically identify complex dynamical systems. I am also interested in learning theory, decision making, motor control, meta science and philosophy of science. From 2013 - 2016, I was an Editor at the [Journal of European Psychology Students](http://jeps.efpsa.org), and since 2016 I am on the board of the [Young Statisticians Netherlands](http://youngstatisticians.nl).
