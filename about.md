I am working as a Veni-funded Postdoctoral Researcher at the Psychological Methods group at the University of Amsterdam, where I am part of the [Bayesian Graphical Modeling Lab](https://bayesiangraphicalmodeling.com/), the [Theory Methods Lab](http://theorymethodslab.com), and the [Psychosystems](http://psychosystems.org) group. I am also partially funded by the [New Science of Mental Disorders (NSMD)](https://nsmd.eu/) gravitation consortium, for which I provide trainings and statistical consultation.

### Research

My research focuses on developing methods for the social and behavioral sciences. My hope is that my methodological work contributes towards empirical research projects that have a positive impact on society and its necessary conditions such as a livable planet. I therefore also collaborate with and provide methodological support to many empirical researchers. My methods research spans three key areas:

**Statistical Modeling.** 
In collaboration with many colleagues, I have worked on network models for cross-sectional data, including the development of the popular R package [mgm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgm/index.html), which allows one to estimate networks with different types of variables, [moderated](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00273171.2019.1677207) (higher order) network models and the estimation of [time-varying](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00273171.2020.1743630) MGMs and mixed variable VAR models. I am currently collaborating with [Maarten Marsman's lab](https://bayesiangraphicalmodeling.com/) on the development of a whole suite around analyzing [network models for ordinal data](https://psyarxiv.com/ukwrf/) using a Bayesian approach. Recently, I have focused more on the issue of analyzing the surge of time series data from daily diary and EMA studies, collaborating with colleagues on the issue of [non-stationarity](https://psyarxiv.com/z7ja2), and different ways to model heterogeneity across persons in VAR models such as [Latent Class VAR models](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ClusterVAR/index.html), [multilevel Hidden Markov Models](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/y2u5s), and many additional ongoing projects in this area.

**Computational Modeling.**
If our goal is to understand and effectively intervene on systems, I find it hard to imagine how we do not end up building computational models. I think that this approach can be very useful even in the early stages of research programs, because it can help clarify theoretical ideas and can improve research designs. My collaborators and I have argued for computational models [in psychology](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691620974697) and [in clinical psychology](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-00806-001) in particular; we have built the first believable [computational model of panic disorder](https://psyarxiv.com/km37w/) and the [first computational model of a CBT treatment for panic disorder](https://psyarxiv.com/tyn9z). We have also recently proposed a [computational model for emotion dynamics](https://psyarxiv.com/x52ns/), with several ongoing computational modeling projects. 

**Natural Language Processing.**
Since the NLP revolution in 2023, we are able to analyze text data at a quality and scale that was unthinkable just a few years ago. I am exploring these new possibilities in several areas. I collaborate on projects in communication science, analyzing media coverage of various topics such as [activist groups](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/yhn54) and climate change at scale. I am also involved in projects investigating how LLMs and embedding models can be used for psychometric scale development ([[here]](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/vf3se_v2)). Finally, I am working within the [MITNB consortium](https://mitnb.org/) on the analysis open-text responses from EMA studies using NLP.

I have found that I can learn a lot from researchers in other disciplines, so I am always involved in a number of interdisciplinary collaborations. For example, we have recently studied how [scientists around the world think about climate change](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02091-2.epdf?sharing_token=xkBJmAb1Oud9czLbgy-JotRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Phrq77IpBMcaX3xXp3kWkBY5Du2ieGxQacCxhLx8I3bHpi0gXYwZmOU96gumvHHJ8F-zDCZmJSMUe3pcWWo753jcoaP21a7rK2HD-FZdzlGhwW4HZ4v_aTIbnSa_W9WuM%3D). I also organize events that bring researchers from different disciplines together. For example, I was part of the organizing team of the [Winter Workshop on Complex Systems (WWCS) in Amsterdam](https://wwcs2023.github.io/) in 2023 and have been part of the WWCS steering committee since then. I am also a founding member and president of the foundation behind the yearly [Amsterdam Complexity School on Climate Change (ACSCC)](https://acscc.nl) hosted by the [Institute for Advanced Study](https://ias.uva.nl/), which brings together (early career) researchers and professionals from government, NGOs, and industry to work on projects related to climate change.

### Education

I previously co-taught the Research Master course Network Analysis and created the new course Formal Theory Lab. Since around 2016, I have taught at the [PSYNETS](https://psychosystems.org/workshops/) winter and summer schools. Currently, I teach the mathematics module of the bachelor's course [Basic Skills in Mathematics, Programming and Statistics](https://coursecatalogue.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2025-2026-en/search-course/course/129123) and a research master course in proof-based [Calculus](https://coursecatalogue.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2025-2026-en/search-course/course/129335).

I supervise research master's internships and research master's and Behavioral Data Science theses. Before the UvA Thesis Speed/Internship Speed Dating event in fall, I share a list of potential projects, but feel free to reach out to me at any moment. I am also happy to discuss your own ambitious project ideas as long as they reasonably fall within my area of expertise.
